Acquaman Bug Tracking List
-----------------------------

Outstanding - Causing crashes
========================
007 - Sept 23: Disabling waterfall inside AMScanView (with AMScanViewMultiScansView shown) -- crash is in AMScanViewMultiChannelsView>>MPlot::setWaterfallLeft()



Outstanding - Wrong behaviour
========================
003 - Sept 15: Dragging scans from data view to experiment folder in sidebar: only one scan is copied, when multiple scans are selected.
005 - Sept 15: Renaming a sample does not trigger an update all the way through to affecting the AMDescriptionRole on scans in AMGenericScanEditor's scanSetModel.
006 - Sept 23: See screenshot bug006.png: MPlot bug: optimized line drawing screws up when two scans are displayed on same plot with very different x-axis scale ranges
008 - Sept 24: Close button actions in qcomboboxes on mac (QCloseItemDelegate) aren't working / aren't working reliably. ex: deleting samples.
009 - Jan 20: Acquired scans aren't automatically saved to the database. Where to do this?
010 - Jan 20: Need a way to check scans to see if they're currently acquirig: both for closing the scan window, and closing scans within a window (Closing an acuiring scan causes crash as scan object is deleted)
011 - Jan 20: Importer doesn't copy over auxiliary data files (additionalFilePaths files)

Fixed:
========================
001 - Sept 15: libvlc playback inside AMVideoPlayerWidget causes crash on linux.  
	Culprit: implicit sharing of onScreenPixmap_ meant that data was not being fully copied before releasing the mutex inside onDisplayCB(). Solved by explicitly calling detach() before releasing mutex.  Also changed type from QPixmap to QImage to avoid conversions when drawing.
	
002 - Sept 15: Importing causes crash (SEGFAULT) when clicking 'Next' or "Apply to All".
	Culprit: AMDbObject::database_ was not being set after a successful storeToDb().  Result

004 - Sept 15: Deferring AMRun dateTime range update doesn't work... because runs are deleted too quickly.
