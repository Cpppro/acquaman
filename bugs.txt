Outstanding - Wrong behaviour
========================





Fixed:
========================
001 - Sept 15: libvlc playback inside AMVideoPlayerWidget causes crash on linux.  
	Culprit: implicit sharing of onScreenPixmap_ meant that data was not being fully copied before releasing the mutex inside onDisplayCB(). Solved by explicitly calling detach() before releasing mutex.  Also changed type from QPixmap to QImage to avoid conversions when drawing.
