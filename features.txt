1.2 User Data Environment
   --> Automate as much as possible
     --> Can (should?) we accomodate those who want to "place" raw data?

   --> Wizard configuration pages for optimization & info collect
   --> Time estimation for scans (or multiple scans) (could reimpliment Ken's code)
   --> Manual or Wizard choice leads either directly to indirectly to all settings page
   --> Queuing multiple scans (Go Button and Add to Workflow Button)
   --> Scan Range: element edge (list or periodic table), user defined favorite, beamline favorite, manual entry
   --> Resolution/Flux: grating, slit + PREDICTOR/SUGGESTOR (learned or programmed?)
   --> Detector Selection: Diagnostics/Setup/Optimization for detectors (when to re-optimize?)
   --> Other: EPU, temperature, angle, etc...

   --> Raw scripting access to classes
     --> Beamline control, scan
     --> Protect as God Mode?

     --> Convenience calls
     --> Force all user scripting to be Workflow Action Objects(?)
   --> Auto-completion
   --> Console window/page
   --> Scripts can call scripts
   --> Create features and combos (WE use to make advanced features like 2D scanning)
   --> Create wrappers (auto-pause on beam loss) (can hide from users, wrap all scans?)

1.7 Workflow
   --> Steps:
     --> Load Samples
       --> Automated guidance, checklists, stop/go lights, beamline feedback, pictures, videos (?)
       --> Move between transfer and measure positions
     --> Optimize beam position
       --> Camera as visual light feedback (short term use crosshair, long term have 3D beam tracking)
       --> Picoammeter + slit + beamline flux profile
     --> Scan Type Selection
     --> Quick Edge Check
       --> Element edge or eV region quick scan
     --> Scan Config
     --> Scan Feedback
       --> to Dataman & scan editor

       --> Save scan/info
       --> Autosave unless stopped
     --> Next Sample/Action
       --> Provide notification, auto-precede after some time
   --> Scan Queue
     --> Queue up scans/actions: new {ScanType}, new movement, run script
     --> Disply like download manager
       --> List in queue, info (metadata and completion %)
       --> Buttons: See all actions/See only scans
   --> Workflow Action Items
     --> Inputs/Outputs
     --> Preconditions/Errors/User Instructions
