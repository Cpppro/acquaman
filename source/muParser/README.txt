These files are from the muParser fast math parsing library, version 1.3.2

http://muparser.sourceforge.net/

Rather than linking a library, we've just included the required files directly, according to
http://muparser.sourceforge.net/mup_usage.html#idInstLinux

All of the parser classes are found within the mu namespace.
